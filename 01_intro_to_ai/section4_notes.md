Section 4: Modern Robotics & Computer Vision

What is Robotics?

Robotics is all about designing and building robots—machines that can do tasks either on their own or with some level of human-like ability. It’s a team effort involving:
- Mechanical engineers (build the body and movement),
- Electronics engineers (make the controls work),
- AI specialists (teach the robot how to “think” and decide).

How AI Fits Into Robotics

AI is what gives robots their smarts. With sensors and cameras, robots can understand and react to their surroundings. Some of the AI tech often used in robots includes:
- Computer Vision: Helping robots “see” and recognize objects.
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping): So robots can navigate and create maps of new spaces.
- Reinforcement Learning: Robots learn from trial and error to make better decisions.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enabling robots to understand and respond to human language.

Computer Vision Basics

Computer vision lets machines interpret images and video. Unlike single pictures, videos are tricky since they’re a stream of images (like 30 frames per second) that need to be understood in context.

Main Computer Vision Models

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- The workhorse for image-related AI.
- They look at images layer-by-layer, learning from simple features (edges) to complex ones (objects).

Transformers
- Originally for language tasks, now being used in vision, especially for generating images.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Mainly used for creating super-realistic images.

Specialized Networks

- U-Net: Used in medical imaging for segmenting areas in pictures.
- EfficientNet: Designed to optimize performance while saving computing resources.

Where Computer Vision is Used

- Self-driving cars, medical imaging, security cameras, face recognition software.
- Even virtual reality is leveraging computer vision to make experiences more immersive.

Robotics is where multiple engineering fields and AI come together to create intelligent machines, and computer vision is a big part of that, helping robots and software see and understand the world.
