Section 1: Intro to AI Engineering


Natural vs Artificial Intelligence

Humans are basically tool-builders — we've always invented stuff to extend our capabilities. A good example from the lecture: Gutenberg’s printing press (1440). Huge leap forward for knowledge sharing, but still just a machine with fixed rules.

That’s the key difference — it couldn't *learn*. So AI came from the idea of building machines that can adapt, learn, and improve, like humans do.

My Take on AI So Far

What is AI?

Seems like AI is basically the goal of making machines that can behave “intelligently” — learning from experience, solving problems, making decisions. It's a big umbrella term with a few main areas:

---

Machine Learning (ML)

One of the core parts of AI. It's all about using data to train models to predict outcomes or classify things. Think of it like this:

- Input → Model → Output  
(e.g., feed in movie history → get recommendations)

Netflix is a common example: they use ML to figure out what you’ll probably enjoy next.

---

Deep Learning (DL)

A more advanced version of ML — uses neural networks to simulate how the human brain processes information. 

The key difference:
- ML = structured algorithms using data
- DL = uses layers (neural nets) to learn complex patterns on its own

Data Science

Sits alongside AI/ML but feels a bit broader. Focuses more on understanding and analyzing data — finding trends, visualizing results, etc. 

Uses a combo of:
- Traditional stats
- ML models
- Business/decision-making insight

e.g. predicting customer orders based on past behavior + explaining why the trend matters.
