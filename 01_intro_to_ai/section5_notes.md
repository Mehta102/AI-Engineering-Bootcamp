Section 5: Generative AI and the Evolution of Language Models

What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to the field of artificial intelligence focused on creating new content—such as text, images, or video—rather than merely analyzing existing data.

- Examples: Tools like ChatGPT (text generation) and DALL·E (image generation) are popular applications.

Core Techniques in Generative AI

- Large Language Models (LLMs): Neural networks trained on large-scale text data that predict and generate human-like language. Core to models like ChatGPT.
- Diffusion Models: Used mainly for image and video generation by starting with noise and refining it into realistic outputs.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Two-model system—one generates content while the other critiques it, improving through competition.
- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs): Focused on building realistic 3D environments.
- Hybrid Models: Combine techniques (e.g., LLMs with GANs) for enhanced flexibility and performance.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Origins and Evolution

Early NLP

- Rule-Based Systems: In the 1950s, NLP systems followed explicit grammar rules to process sentences.
- Example**: Recognizing "Can you help me?" as a question based on its structure.

Rise of Statistical NLP

- Probabilistic Methods: Replaced rules with statistical analysis of large corpora in the 1980s–90s.
- Example: Determining if “can” is a noun or verb by examining its context in surrounding words.

Advancements in NLP with Machine Learning

Vector Embeddings

- Word Representation: Words and phrases are converted into numerical vectors in high-dimensional space.
- Semantic Understanding: These vectors capture meaning and relationships between words.

Deep Learning and Neural Networks

- Understanding Context: Neural networks improved the ability to recognize subtleties like irony or sarcasm.
- Adoption in Tasks: Used in machine translation, speech recognition, and summarization.

Transformer Architecture

- Breakthrough (2018): Transformers allowed for parallel processing and better sequence understanding.
- Enabled LLMs: The architecture behind models like GPT and Gemini.

Language Models and Their Types

- Masked Language Models: Predict missing words within a sentence (e.g., BERT).
- Autoregressive Models: Predict the next word based on previous words (e.g., GPT).

Learning Paradigms in LLM Development

Supervised Learning

- Challenge: Requires labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to produce.

Unsupervised Learning

- Limitation: No clear training objectives; lacks the structure necessary for language comprehension.

Self-Supervised Learning

- Balanced Solution: Uses context within data to generate pseudo-labels, enabling scalable training.
- Application: Core to LLMs like ChatGPT.

NLP Model Evolution

| Model Type | Description | Strengths | Limitations |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| N-grams | Predict next word using previous (n−1) words | Simple | Poor long-range context |
| RNNs | Sequential models with memory | Better context | Vanishing gradient |
| LSTMs | Gated memory cells | Long-term memory | Slow training |
| Transformers | Parallel processing | Handles context well | Computational cost |

Phases of Building LLMs

1. Model Design
   - Architecture choice (e.g., transformer)
   - Parameter scaling
2. Dataset Engineering
   - Data sourcing, cleaning, and diversity
3. Pretraining
   - Learning from massive unlabeled corpora
4. Preliminary Evaluation
   - Measuring early performance
5. Post-training and Finetuning
   - Supervised learning and human feedback
6. Final Testing
   - Evaluation on accuracy, speed, safety

Optimization Techniques: Prompting, Finetuning, RAG

- Prompt Engineering: Refines input to guide the model without modifying it.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Adds external databases to the model’s input for context-aware answers.
- Finetuning: Adjusts internal weights for better performance on specific tasks.

Foundation Models and the Buy-vs-Make Debate

What Are Foundation Models?

- Definition: Large, versatile models trained to serve many tasks.
- Use Cases: Not just text—also handle code, images, spreadsheets, and more.

Strategic Implications

- Buy vs Make: Building a model is costly. Most businesses rely on API access (e.g., OpenAI).
- Adaptation is Key: Competitive edge comes from adapting models via prompting, RAG, or fine-tuning.
- Talent Need: Growing demand for engineers skilled at applying and refining foundation models.
